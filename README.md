# resume

I have built my resume based on JSON. It has some advantages, like: easy editing, custom styleing, versioning, etc.

## Edit
`resume.json` schema is based on [gitconnected API](https://gitconnected.com).
You can use [gitconnected](https://gitconnected.com) to fill the json, and replacing its url intead of `resume.json` in `script.js`.
e.g. `https://gitconnected.com/v1/portfolio/saman`

## PDF version
You can just use the print window of a browser (Chrome is recommended) to generate the PDF version.

## Feedback
It's recommneded to use [Resume Worded](https://resumeworded.com/first-login-home.php) to get a high score on your resume.
