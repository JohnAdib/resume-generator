# resume

I have built my resume based on JSON. It has some advantages, like easy editing, custom styling, versioning, etc.

## Edit
`resume.json` schema is based on [gitconnected API](https://gitconnected.com).
You can use [gitconnected](https://gitconnected.com) to fill the JSON and replacing its URL instead of `resume.json` in `script.js`.
e.g., `https://gitconnected.com/v1/portfolio/saman`.

## Usage
You need a web server to see the output of this project. If you have Node.js installed, you can use the [serve package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) to run a web server or your local machine.

## PDF version
You can just use the print window of a browser (Chrome is recommended) to generate the PDF version.

## Feedback
It's recommended to use [Resume Worded](https://resumeworded.com/first-login-home.php) to get a high score on your resume.
