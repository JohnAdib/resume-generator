# resume

I have built my resume based on JSON. It has some advantages, like easy editing, custom styling, versioning, etc.

## Edit
Simply edit the `data.json` file and make sure is a valid JSON.

## Usage
You need a web server to see the output of this project. If you have Node.js installed, you can use the [serve package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) to run a web server or your local machine.

Just go the project folder and run this command
```
$ serve
```
Or, If you have PHP installed, you can use the PHP built in web server. 
Just go the project folder and run this command
```
$ php -S localhost:8000
```

## PDF version
The css is optimized for printing in A4 format. You can just use the print window of a browser (Chrome is recommended) to generate the PDF version.

## Feedback
It is recommended to use [Resume Worded](https://resumeworded.com/first-login-home.php) to get a high score on your resume.
